# CIAN PARSER

This project was conceived as a tool for collecting data on apartments from the cian.ru website with further recording in the PostgreSQL database.
Cian has its own API, but access to it is given only to realtors and representatives of real estate agencies.
In this iteration, data collection is limited to St. Petersburg, mostly due to technical limitations.
In the future, it is planned to analyze the data and make a decision support system, then put it on a special website to help potential sellers determine the most competitive price for their property, and also provide information support to buyers who are about to enter the real estate market in order to give advice on prices, according to their requirements and preferences.

The main library is located in the cian_parser directory.
Data collection occurs with the launch of the scraping.py file.
